# Coffe-Shop-Sales

## Objective
The main objective of this dashboard is to analyze the coffee shop’s sales data, footfall, product preferences, and customer behavior to identify key patterns, trends, and insights. This helps in making data-driven decisions to improve profitability, customer engagement, and optimize operations.

## Key Insights
•Total Sales and Footfall: The sales volume shows that the average customer spends moderately on each visit.
•Sales by Day of the Week: Peak sales are on the weekends, which might suggest more foot traffic due to leisure activities.
•Top Products:The top-selling product is Barista Espresso with a total of $91,406.20 in sales. Other top products include Brewed Chai Tea, Hot Chocolate, Gourmet Brewed, and Brewed Black Tea.
•Monthly Sales Distribution:	January has the highest sales (24% of total), followed by April (23%).	March and May have lower sales at 12% and 17%, respectively. Seasonality seems to affect sales, possibly due to colder months and festivities increasing footfall.
•Hourly Quantity Ordered:	Peak hours are from 10 AM to 2 PM, which indicates high activity during morning to lunchtime.	Sales drop after 3 PM, indicating a slower afternoon and evening period. This data can help in staff allocation and managing operational costs during off-peak hours.
•Sales by Size of Orders: Large-sized and medium-sized orders dominate followed by small-sized orders. This could indicate a customer preference for value-based purchases or group orders.
•Store Location Performance:	Stores located in Lower Manhattan generate the highest sales, followed by Astoria. Hell’s Kitchen sees lower sales compared to other locations but still performs adequately.
•Sales by Product Category:	Beverages contribute the most to sales, with hot beverages like coffee and tea being the most popular.	Food categories like snacks or pastries have relatively lower sales, suggesting they could be areas of improvement.

## Conclusions:

	1.	Weekend Focus:
	•	The sales are higher on Fridays and Saturdays, suggesting that the coffee shop should focus on promotions or events during weekends to further boost traffic.
	2.	Product Strategy:
	•	There’s a clear demand for espresso and large-sized beverages. Introducing new variants of popular products or combo deals with large-sized orders may increase sales further.
	3.	Operational Adjustments:
	•	With the peak sales happening during mid-morning and early afternoon, staff schedules and inventory management should prioritize these hours to ensure smooth service.
	4.	Location Optimization:
	•	Stores in Lower Manhattan outperform others, which may warrant further expansion or focus on this area. Lower-performing locations, such as Hell’s Kitchen, should consider targeted marketing to boost sales.
	5.	Seasonal Promotions:
	•	Given the drop in sales during March and May, the coffee shop can implement seasonal promotions, like spring-themed beverages or loyalty programs, to maintain consistent sales across months.

 This analysis provides an overview of the coffee shop’s current performance, identifies areas of strength, and offers insights on where improvements could be made to drive growth and profitability.
